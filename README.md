## Data sourcing and cleaning
This data set updated every 5 minutes and was pulled in using a URL of the JSON object. 

#### Installation and Setup
The first step of running this repo is visiting https://account.mapbox.com and copying the default public token. This token can be used to create an API_KEY. You will need to add the API_KEY into a file you create called config.js this file should be put into the Leaflet-Step-1 folder. Be sure to wrap the default public token in quotes and initialized the variable API_KEY with var. 

After the config file has been added the index.html can be opened with a live server and the visualizations can be viewed.
